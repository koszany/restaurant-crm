# Coding Task: Restaurant Order Management System

## Objective
Design an API for a simplified restaurant order management system that handles the creation, updating, and viewing of customer orders. This task will assess your ability to structure a Rails application from scratch, design a clean and scalable architecture, and implement basic business logic in a modular way.

## Overview
The API should allow for:

- Listing all menu items with their prices.
- Creating a new order with specified menu items and quantities.
- Listing all orders, including the total cost of each order.
- Updating order statuses (new, in preparation, served, cancelled).
- Persisting created orders so they are available after an application restart.

## Requirements
- You may use any frameworks and tools you prefer.
- The task evaluates your design skills, so be mindful of best practices for designing a RESTful API.
- Write tests to ensure the reliability of your system.
- Keep it simpleâ€”do not spend more than 4 hours on this task. If something would require additional time or if you identify areas for improvement, leave a comment on how you would approach it.
- Prepare a README with instructions for installing and running your application.
